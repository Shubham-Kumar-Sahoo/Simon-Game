# Simon-Game
In this project, I have used HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a webpage to play online Simon Game. 

Simon is a game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates,[1] with software programming by Lenny Cope. This game creates a series of colour pattern and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails to repeat the correct sequence, the game is over. 

### To Play

1. To start this online Simon game press any key.
2. Then click on the colour that is highlighted and with each level repeat the progressive colour series to go to the next level. If you fail to repeat the colour series then the game will be over.
3. Then to restart the game again press any key.
